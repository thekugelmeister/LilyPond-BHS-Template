This is a project to create a template for LilyPond to make engraved scores match the Barbershop Notation Manual. The Barbershop Notation Manual may be found at http://www.barbershop.org/files/documents/getandmakemusic/Barbershop%20Notation%20Manual.pdf

NOTE: Currently using the 2013-07-11 revision. Will update to the 2015 version soon.

LilyPond does a very nice job of producing scores correctly notated, but the Barbershop Harmony Society has requirements for publication to maintain a consistent appearance across arrangements.

This repository is designed to allow the Barbershop arranger to worry more about the correct words and notes than whether the page looks right.

As an example, this template comes with Shine On, Harvest Moon. The goal of this template is to make LilyPond's output of Shine On, Harvest Moon match that of Shine On Harvest Moon as shown in the Barbershop Notation Manual.

For the arranger, modify title.ly. Update the key and time signatures and the song data. Update the words and music found in each part's folder. Optionally, change the name of score.ly to <<Name Of Song>>.ly and run score.ly through LilyPond.

PREREQUISITES
