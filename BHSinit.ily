%% The goal of this package is to surround the LilyPond backend with an API of
%% sorts. Wherever possible, it would be preferable for the user to interact
%% with the opaque abstraction defined here.
%%
%% This script initializes the components of this abstraction, effectively
%% making them available for use by the end user.

%% place their name in all relevant fields. Formatting will be handled
%% automatically.
